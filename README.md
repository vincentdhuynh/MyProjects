# Data Analysis Portfolio

This repository contains data analysis portfolio projects for the purpose of self-learning and presentation of skills developed in the form of MySQL and Microsoft Excel files. 


1. Microsoft Excel - Coffee Sales Dashboard.

Interactive dashboard that is designed to revolutionize the way users can analyze and visualize coffee sales data. This tool allows coffee shop owners, managers, and enthusiasts to gain deep insights into their business's performance, all at their fingertips.

2. MySQL - Cyclistic Bike Share Analysis

In the pursuit of Cyclistic's growth and profitability, focus has shifted to maximizing annual memberships as a strategic imperative. To facilitate this transition, I've engaged in data-driven analysis to understand the nuances that differentiate casual riders from loyal annual members. With access to a comprehensive dataset detailing rider behavior, I aim to provide actionable insights that will form the foundation of a results-oriented marketing strategy. 

This data-centric approach is geared towards converting casual riders into annual members effectively and achieving Cyclistic's growth objectives in the competitive urban mobility landscape.
